How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log: used to show a ledger of all commits with corresponding comments. Also able to see user that commited, date of commit, etc. 
Comes with a commit # that can be used for comparrison or reference.

git diff: uses commit #'s to compare code within file and show +'s and -'s corresponding to added or subtracted code.
