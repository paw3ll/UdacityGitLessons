When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to have access to your repository from anywhere with internet access you would want to have a remote
repo. or if you chose to have multiple individuals working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git does not live update, so always pulling before you begin work on something ensures that you will be able to
keep the most live version.
