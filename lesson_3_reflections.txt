When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to have access to your repository from anywhere with internet access you would want to have a remote
repo. or if you chose to have multiple individuals working on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Git does not live update, so always pulling before you begin work on something ensures that you will be able to
keep the most live version.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks work by creating clones on git's website, taking and referencing an individuals repo in your own set.
Clones create local versions of repos, using init then clone creates a completelty new repo with no past metadata. 
Branch takes a clone / fork and takes the repo off in a seperate direction from the master. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Having a copy of the last known state remotely stored allows for you to have the assurance of knowing that if there is 
a fast foward merge or something breaks you have a remote version of the code that is unaffected.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Collaboration without git hub would mean users are storing local copies of the project and editing as they work,
and when wanting to merge everyone would have to come together and copy and paste code into one final master. Then trouble shoot
all bugs that may have happened. As well as the issue of making sure ever piece of code that has been changed
gets added as one can change several things as they work.
