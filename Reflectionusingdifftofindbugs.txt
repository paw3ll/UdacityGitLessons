Q: How did viewing a diff between two version help you spot the bug.
A: Using git bash and viewing the difference between new_game.js and old_game.js allowed me to see the +'s and -'s and know exactly where code has been changed and where to look for errors. 
Rather than trying to remember myself exactly where has been changed and hunting down for it. Visualization of the changes assist greatly in knowing where to begin your search.
