What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git,
vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
 
 
Pros of being able to manually chose when to commit:
One is able to establish the timeline they want for their coding project. Increments can be as few or farbetween as the creator wants
and able to create the pace that they want for commits. Also allows user to have more full control. 

Cons of being able to manually chose when to commit:
User is able to oversatturate the commits, or possibly not commit frequently enough and push a large commit that's overbearing.
